#   People have opinions. But unfortunetly, those       #
#   opinions are often incorrect. This program aims to  #
#   do what any good program does: correct human        #
#   miatakes. One of the most common options held       #
#   deeply within a human is the idea of a              #
#   favorite number. This program attempts to expoilt   #
#   the human arrogance and gullibility by asking them  #
#   for their favorite number, and then strategically   #
#   adding 1 in order to create confusion. This         #
#   confusion can then be exploited to implant a        #
#   natural psychological weapon and essentially take   #
#   down every human from the inside, one by one.       #
#                                                       #
